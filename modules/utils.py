# modules/utils.py

"""
This module contains utility functions that are used across multiple pages
of the Streamlit application. This helps to avoid code duplication and
keep the page scripts cleaner.

Functions:
- page_setup(): Configures the basic Streamlit page settings like title, icon, and layout.
- check_login(): A security check to ensure a user is logged in before accessing a page.
- get_db_session(): A context manager to handle database sessions reliably.
- get_user_id(username): Fetches the user's database ID based on their username.

    Sets up the Streamlit page configuration, logo, and title.

def check_login():

    Checks if the user is authenticated by looking at the session state.

    If the user is not authenticated (i.e., 'authentication_status' is not True),

    This function is crucial for protecting pages that should only be accessible
    to logged-in users.

def get_db_session():

    A context manager for safely handling database sessions.
    It ensures that the database session is always closed, even if errors occur.

    Yields:
